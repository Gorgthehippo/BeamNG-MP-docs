In order to run this your self you will need to download this repository and zip the lua, scripts and ui folders up into one zip file so you have something like:

````
BeamNG-MP.zip
  ├─ lua/
  ├─ scripts/
  └─ ui/
````

Then put this in your mods folder typically located at Documents/BeamNG.drive/mods.

You will also require the "Bridge" downloadable from here: https://github.com/Starystars67/BeamNG-MP-Bridge/releases
